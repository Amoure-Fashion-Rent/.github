## Description : 
This application is born from common frustrations like the prevalent conundrum of "having nothing to wear" dilemma. Despite full closets, they often don't match current fashion or needs. Additionally, we face limited wear from certain garments, mostly saved only for special occasions. Conventional methods, like direct rentals or purchasing high-quality items for sporadic and infrequent wear, are major concerns driving the creation of our project application.
